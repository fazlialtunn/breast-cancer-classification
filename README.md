# Breast Cancer Classification with Random Forest

This project performs breast cancer classification using Python. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, scaling, training, and model evaluation steps.

---

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to classify breast tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B) based on various features extracted from tumor images.

A Random Forest classifier is used, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

---

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## Dataset

- The dataset is provided in the file `data.csv`.
- It contains 569 samples and 31 features.
- Features represent measurements and properties of tumors.
- The target column is `diagnosis` (M = malignant, B = benign).

---

## Steps

1. **Load and preprocess data**  
   - Drop unnecessary columns (`id` and `Unnamed: 32`).
   - Check for missing values.
   - View basic statistics of the data.

2. **Data visualization**  
   - Use seaborn violin plots to visualize feature distributions by diagnosis.

3. **Feature scaling**  
   - Scale numerical features to the [0, 1] range using MinMaxScaler.

4. **Train-test split**  
   - Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

5. **Model training**  
   - Train a Random Forest classifier on the training data.

6. **Model evaluation**  
   - Calculate accuracy scores on both training and testing datasets.

---

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

	2.	Clone the repository or download the files.
	3.	Make sure data.csv is in the same directory as the script.
	4.	Run the Python script:

python breast_cancer_classification.py


⸻

Sample Output
	•	Training accuracy: 1.0 (perfect fit on training data)
	•	Test accuracy: 0.974 (97.4% accuracy on unseen test data)

⸻

Notes
	•	Although the model performs well, be cautious of potential overfitting.
	•	Visualization and scaling are important preprocessing steps for better model performance.
	•	Future improvements could include hyperparameter tuning and trying other classification models.
